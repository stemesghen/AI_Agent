  "content_text": "Libyan Militias Carried Out 60 Violent Attacks At Sea Since 2016, New Report Reveals\nA new report by the maritime search and rescue organisation Sea-Watch reveals that Libyan militias, including the so-called Libyan coastguard, have carried out 60 violent attacks at sea since 2016, targeting migrants, civil actors, and EU state personnel. Out of these, 54 attacks were attributed specifically to the Libyan coastguard.\nThe research, titled ‚ÄòEpisodes of violence by the so-called Libyan coastguard and other Libyan militias at sea: 2016 ‚Üí September 2025‚Äô, is the first to systematically document extreme acts of violence in the Mediterranean committed by Libyan actors. Experts caution that the actual number of incidents is likely much higher, as many attacks go unreported.\nDocumented acts include shootings, hijacking of rescue vessels, dangerous maneuvers near boats in distress, physical assault of migrants, abandonment of bodies at sea, and obstruction of rescue operations.\nAt least 54 of the attacks occurred in international waters, either in the Maltese search and rescue region or in the so-called Libyan zone. Migrants remain the primary victims of these violent actions.\nIn 2024 alone, the International Organisation for Migration reported that more than 21,700 people were forcibly taken to Libya, where they face systemic abuse, including torture, slavery, and sexual violence.\n‚ö°Ô∏èCOMMUNIQU√â‚ö°Ô∏è\nHier apr√®s-midi l‚ÄôOcean Viking a √©t√© d√©lib√©r√©ment pris pour cible par les garde-c√¥tes libyens.

East Libya is currently controlled by General Khalifa Haftar, a convicted war criminal.\nThe report highlights that attacks are still occurring. Just last weekend, Alarm Phone reported a shooting by the Libyan coastguard at a boat in distress, leaving one person shot in the head and two others injured.\nIn late August, the rescue ship Ocean Viking came under 20 minutes of heavy gunfire, followed by a similar attack on the Sea-Watch 5 a month later.\nSea-Watch added that the report focuses on the most visible and direct forms of violence, which occur within a system of illegal and coercive migrant interceptions.\nReference: sea-watch\n‚öìÔ∏è Enhance Your Knowledge.
