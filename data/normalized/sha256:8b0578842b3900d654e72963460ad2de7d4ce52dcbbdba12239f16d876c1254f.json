  "content_text": "India Commissions Largest Slipway Cradle In Kochi To Strengthen Blue Economy\nIndia has advanced its marine infrastructure by commissioning a 250-tonne slipway cradle in Kochi, the largest government-owned vessel cradle in the country.\nThe facility, built by the Fishery Survey of India (FSI) at a cost of ‚Çπ1.78 crore, was inaugurated by Union Minister of State for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying George Kurian on Wednesday.\nThe heavy-duty steel structure has been designed to safely haul and launch vessels of up to 250 tonnes displacement, offering docking and maintenance support for a wide range of craft, from fishermen‚Äôs boats to sophisticated research vessels.\nThe system can accommodate six vessels simultaneously across different berths, significantly improving repair and servicing capabilities at the Kochi complex.\nAccording to the Union Minister, the facility represents a major step in India‚Äôs vision for a sustainable blue economy. He added that the facility would benefit fishers, government agencies, and marine stakeholders by ensuring uninterrupted operations for marine research, stock assessments, ecosystem monitoring and surveys.\nKurian further stated that under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), transponders are being installed on fishing vessels in collaboration with ISRO to enhance safety at sea and enable real-time communication.\nThe system will also integrate potential fishing zone forecasts, allowing fishers to receive reliable information about fish-rich areas directly through the transponders.\nFSI Director General Sreenath K. R. described the new cradle as a critical enabler for the deep-sea fleet modernisation drive envisioned under PMMSY. He explained that as fishers are encouraged to invest in modern, technologically advanced vessels, providing them with world-class maintenance infrastructure is essential.\nHe added that the facility ensures these new assets remain in prime operational condition, extending their lifespan and ensuring safety for fishers at sea.\nThe cradle‚Äôs design provides balanced support to vessel hulls during movement along the slipway, operating with an electric winch system to control hauling from water to shore. Its robust construction allows for smooth and safe handling of heavy vessels.\nThe FSI slipway complex will also cater to craft used by the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), Indian Coast Guard, Customs, Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (CIFT), and the Lakshadweep Fisheries Department.\nThe facility is also expected to serve Kochi Water Metro vessels, inland water transport vessels, tourism crafts, and private deep-sea operators.\nOfficials said the new cradle will not only support the maintenance of diverse vessel types but also strengthen India‚Äôs capacity for continuous marine research and sustainable fisheries management.\nReferences: TOI, thehindubusinessline\n‚öìÔ∏è Enhance Your Knowledge.
