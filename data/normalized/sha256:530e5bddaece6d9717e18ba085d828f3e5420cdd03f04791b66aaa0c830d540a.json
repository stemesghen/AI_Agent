  "content_text": "World’s First Environmental Value Created through Operation of NYK Ammonia-fueled Tugboat Expanding the environmental contribution potential of fuel ammonia (11)\nShin Nippon Kaiyosha obtained third-party certification on 25th September, 2025 for the environmental value1 representing the quantified greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduced through the towage services2 provided by the ammonia-fueled tugboat Sakigake (the “vessel”).\nThis certified environmental value can be allocated to purchasers through the Book & Claim method3 and is expected to contribute to the reduction of Scope 3 emissions4 by transportation service users in the future. This is the world’s first instance that environmental value derived through the operation of an ammonia-fueled vessel has received third-party validation.\nSelected in October 2021 as part of NEDO’s5 Green Innovation Fund project, “Developmentof ships withammonia fueled domestic engines”, Sakigake is the world’s first ammonia-fueled vessel developed for commercial use. The vessel is fueled by low-environmental-impact ammonia “ECOANN,”6 manufactured by Resonac Corporation and provided by JERA Co., Ltd. Since its completion in August 2024, Sakigake has been providing safe and low-carbon tugboat services in Yokohama port.\nGHG emissions from cargo transportation are commonly classified as Scope 3 for transport service users, requiring collaboration across the entire supply chain to reduce them. By visualizing GHG reductions in the shipping industry, this initiative paves the way for future Scope 3 emission reductions by shippers and consideration of additional GHG reduction measures, further expanding the potential environmental contribution of ammonia as a marine fuel.\nMoving forward, NYK will continue to focus on developing a fuel ammonia value chain and advancing decarbonization within the shipping and marine industries. This commitment includes the development of the ammonia-fueled medium gas carrier (AFMGC), scheduled for completion in November 2026, that NYK is developing in collaboration with others.\nSource: Nippon Yusen Kaisha"
