  "content_text": "Sweden Closes Baltic Sea Cable Sabotage Probe, Concludes It Was An Accident\nSwedish authorities have officially closed their investigation into the suspected sabotage of a Baltic Sea communications cable between Sweden and Latvia, concluding that the incident was accidental and caused by severe weather, technical failures, and inadequate seamanship aboard the vessel involved.\nThe preliminary investigation began after damage was discovered on 26 January 2025 in the submarine fibre-optic cable linking Gotland in Sweden with Ventspils in Latvia.\nThe Malta-flagged dry bulk carrier Vezhen, owned by Bulgaria‚Äôs Navigation Maritime Bulgare, was detained by Swedish authorities on suspicion of causing the damage but was later released on 3 February after prosecutors found no evidence of deliberate sabotage.\nAccording to the Swedish Prosecution Authority, the findings showed that the cable break was the result of a combination of harsh weather, mechanical defects, and operational shortcomings rather than any intentional act.\nSenior Prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist of the National Security Unit stated that the incident was determined to be an accident following a thorough investigation.\nThe investigation was carried out in coordination with the Swedish Security Service (S√§kerhetspolisen), the Police Authority (Polismyndigheten), the Coast Guard, and the Armed Forces.\nAuthorities conducted a detailed technical examination, analysed the ship‚Äôs voyage data recorder (black box), and reviewed onboard video recordings. Several witness interviews were also conducted to piece together the events surrounding the damage.\nFindings from the investigation revealed that Vezhen‚Äôs anchor system was not fully functional at the time of the incident. A ship‚Äôs anchor is typically secured by three independent safety mechanisms, but two of them had been non-operational for some time. The only functioning device, known as the ‚ÄúBj√∂rnl√•s,‚Äù reportedly failed after being struck by a powerful wave at 04:11 on 25 January.\nWhen the device broke, the anchor and its chain were released, causing the vessel to lose speed and rotate. The autopilot, which was active, automatically compensated for this movement, and no alarm alerted the crew. The next day, the ship‚Äôs dragging anchor struck and severed the undersea fibre-optic cable off Gotland, within Sweden‚Äôs exclusive economic zone.\nThe Swedish prosecutor‚Äôs office stated that the incident occurred amid heavy storms in the Baltic Sea and concluded that the cable was not damaged intentionally. As such, the office confirmed that Sweden had no jurisdiction to pursue any negligence-related offences.\nProsecutors in February ruled out sabotage, and the vessel was released. The investigation‚Äôs findings were handed over to Latvian authorities in the spring of 2025, who are continuing their own investigation.\nThe damage had earlier led to speculation that it might be linked to hybrid warfare by Russia, but Swedish investigators found no evidence of deliberate interference or foreign involvement.\nReferences: sverigesradio, AFP\n‚öìÔ∏è Enhance Your Knowledge.
