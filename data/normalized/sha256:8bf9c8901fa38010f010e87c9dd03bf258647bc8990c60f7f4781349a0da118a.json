This marked a historic milestone for Reach Subsea and a significant step forward for remote-controlled subsea services.\nVideo Credits: Reach Subsea/Facebook\nThe vessel is the first in a new class of USVs designed to carry out offshore tasks while reducing emissions and minimising the need for crew at sea. It also features integrated Work Class ROV capability.\nReach Subsea‚Äôs CEO, Jostein Alendal, said the Reach Remote programme is improving subsea operations with ocean robotics through strong collaboration with the company and Norwegian authorities.\nThe company‚Äôs COO, Inge Grutle, stated that the vessel‚Äôs remote operations have demonstrated an equal or higher level of maritime safety and situational awareness compared with traditional manned vessels.\nReach Subsea is further developing autonomous offshore work with Reach Remote 2 heading to Australia and Reach Remote 3 and 4 currently under construction.\nReference: reachsubsea\n‚öìÔ∏è Enhance Your Knowledge.
