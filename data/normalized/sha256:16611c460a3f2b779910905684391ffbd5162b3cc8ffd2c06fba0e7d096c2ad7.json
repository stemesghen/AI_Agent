  "content_text": "Marine battery manufacturer AYK Energy achieves industry-leading standard in cyber security\nMarine battery innovator and manufacturer AYK Energy has achieved an industry-leading standard of maritime cyber security.\nIts capability for remote service and software updates have earned an enhanced system level certification from the world’s leading classification society DNV.\nAYK has received the certification under DNV Cyber Security profile Level 1 (SP1) and IACS UR E27.\nThe manufacturer has worked with DNV to ensure compliance with the highest protocols and to alleviate the risk of cyber security breaches when accessing ship-board control systems remotely.\nThe online monitoring of batteries on vessels enables AYK to ensure they are working to their optimum efficiency, can prevent problems occurring and fix any issues that develop.\nAYK’s industry-leading work to access its products remotely and analyze the data underlines its role as one of the sector’s prime innovators.\nAYK Energy’s founder Chris Kruger says the certification reinforces the company’s ongoing commitment to leading the marine industry’s push to decarbonize.\nHe said: “We have designed our batteries to allow remote access, which enables remote support during commissioning and remote software updates.\n“Once installed, bugs and faults can be fixed remotely, and data can be easily uploaded to The Cloud for storage and processing.”\n“This certification is a significant milestone in our ongoing work to allow our customers to realize the full benefits of our battery technology on board their vessels through this monitoring and support.\n“The question of cyber security is an industry-wide issue. Ship owners and operators need to be confident that the right protocols are in place to protect their systems if they are to give access to outside organizations. That access has to be secure.\n“The certification we have received emphasizes our commitment to continuing lead when it comes to battery technology and in finding and applying robust solutions that deliver cyber security.”\nHe added: “We are working towards being able to access real-time information from the batteries on the vessels that we supply. This latest significant milestone takes us nearer to that goal.”\nSource: AYK Energy"
