  "content_text": "U.S. Strikes Another Suspected Drug Boat Off Venezuela, Killing Six\nThe United States military has carried out another strike on a boat accused of trafficking narcotics off the Venezuelan coast, killing six people on board, President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday.\nThe strike marks at least the fifth such incident in the Caribbean in recent weeks as the US continues to intensify its maritime operations in the region.\nTrump stated that the vessel was operating in international waters and was ‚Äúaffiliated with a designated terrorist organisation.‚Äù He added that intelligence had confirmed the boat‚Äôs involvement in narcotics trafficking and its links to illegal narco-terrorist networks. However, he did not identify the group or provide supporting evidence.\nThe strike was ordered by US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth early on Tuesday morning. A short black-and-white video released by Trump and later shared by Hegseth showed a stationary boat being struck by a projectile from above before erupting into flames. Trump said that no US personnel were injured in the operation.\nThe Pentagon informed Congress that the Trump administration considers the United States to be engaged in an ‚Äúarmed conflict‚Äù with drug cartels that have been classified as terrorist organisations.\nAccording to officials, the smugglers are being treated as ‚Äúunlawful combatants,‚Äù which has raised concerns among legal experts and lawmakers about the justification and legality of such strikes under international law.\nhttps://t.co/AYyPZuUsm9 pic.twitter.com/1gY3vBnvqa\n‚Äî Pete Hegseth (@PeteHegseth) October 14, 2025\nSome former military lawyers have pointed out that targeting suspected traffickers instead of attempting to detain them may not meet the requirements of the law of armed conflict. Per reports, one of the previously targeted vessels had turned away before being hit.\nRepublican Senator Rand Paul has opposed this policy and said Congress should take back its authority over military actions. He has supported a War Powers resolution to stop the president from ordering such strikes without approval, warning that blowing up boats without due process could lead to unnecessary escalation and possible regime change efforts.\nThese operations have further increased tensions between the United States and Venezuela. Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro has accused Washington of trying to destabilise his government and has considered declaring a state of emergency due to the growing U.S. military presence near Venezuelan waters.\nRecently, the U.S. also doubled its reward to $50 million for information leading to Maduro‚Äôs arrest, accusing him of involvement in drug trafficking, claims he denies.\nThe U.S. currently maintains a significant military presence in the southern Caribbean, comprising eight warships, thousands of sailors and marines, F-35 fighter jets stationed in Puerto Rico, and a nuclear-powered submarine.\nReference: Reuters\n‚öìÔ∏è Enhance Your Knowledge.
