  "content_text": "GTT, BLOOM ENERGY and PONANT EXPLORATIONS GROUP partner on integrated energy system for sustainable shipping\nGTT, BLOOM ENERGY and PONANT EXPLORATIONS GROUP today announced a joint innovation project to develop an integrated energy system combining Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) powered by LNG[1] with Marine Carbon Capture designed to cover the vessel’s energy needs related to onboard consumption. This breakthrough system is expected to equip PONANT EXPLORATIONS GROUP’s future Swap2Zero cruise vessel by 2030, which will be propelled by wind-assisted system and fuel cells.\nAs part of this project, GTT will design and develop a Marine Carbon Capture system compatible with BLOOM ENERGY’s SOFC technology. This integrated solution will supply auxiliary electricity for the vessel, covering hotel load such as lighting, hot water, and onboard services, while also capturing CO₂ from the exhaust gases. This dual approach, combining emission reduction and the reuse of low-temperature energy from the ship’s cryogenic installations will further enhances the overall efficiency of the SOFC system through optimised thermal management.\nThis initiative reflects the partners’ shared commitment to advancing the decarbonisation of maritime transport. By combining their expertise, they aim to develop next-generation onboard energy solutions that demonstrate the critical role of advanced technologies in this transition, supporting the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) objectives and accelerating the shift towards low-emission operations.\nPhilippe Berterottière, Chairman and CEO of GTT, commented: “Combining GTT’s technology and expertise with our partners’ is how we will design the ships of the future and accelerate the decarbonisation of maritime transport. This project reflects our shared ambition to deliver high-performance and innovative solutions that support the sector. We are proud to contribute to this ambitious and forward-looking initiative.”\nAman Joshi, Chief Commercial Officer of BLOOM ENERGY, commented: “We see solid oxide fuel cells as a cornerstone of the maritime industry’s low-carbon future. We’re proud to contribute to the Swap2Zero project, an ambitious collaboration focused on developing next-generation vessels aligned with the IMO’s carbon reduction vision. Powered by LNG, BLOOM ENERGY’s high-efficiency solid oxide fuel cell system not only delivers best-in-class electrical conversion but also captures and repurposes waste heat for onboard heating and cooling loads. By integrating fuel cells with onboard carbon capture and sequestration, this initiative exemplifies how innovation and collaboration can accelerate the transition to cleaner, more sustainable shipping.”\nMathieu Petiteau, Newbuilding and R&D Director of PONANT EXPLORATIONS GROUP, commented: “This partnership is a key milestone in developing innovative and efficient ways to capture CO2 and embodies our commitment to finding new solutions to decarbonising the maritime industry. It also marks another step forward for our Swap2Zero vessel project, co-funded by the European Union Innovation Fund and France 2030. It represents an important step towards delivering the next generation of low-emission vessels.”\nSource: GTT"
