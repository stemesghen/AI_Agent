  "content_text": "NATO Chief Mocks ‚ÄòBroken‚Äô Russian Submarine Seen Limping Through European Waters\nNATO chief Mark Rutte has mocked Russia over the condition of one of its submarines after it was seen surfacing off France, while Moscow has rejected reports of any malfunction, claiming the vessel was simply complying with navigation rules during a routine transit.\nAccording to Russia‚Äôs Black Sea Fleet, the diesel-electric submarine Novorossiysk surfaced off the French coast as part of a ‚Äúscheduled inter-fleet transit‚Äù after completing operations in the Mediterranean.\nThe fleet said the vessel was following international navigation regulations, which require submarines to travel through the English Channel only while on the surface.\nThe Russian submarine, Novorossiysk, was escorted through the North Sea by the Dutch navy and a towing vessel, Yakov Grebelsky, drawing international attention.\nThe Royal Navy reported monitoring the surfaced submarine and its support tug between 7 and 9 October as they moved from the English Channel into the North Sea, part of a coordinated NATO tracking operation.\nSpeaking at an event in Slovenia, Rutte reportedly joked that the submarine appeared ‚Äúbroken‚Äù and was ‚Äúlimping home from patrol‚Äù, adding that there was now ‚Äúhardly any Russian naval presence left in the Mediterranean‚Äù.\nHe compared the situation to Tom Clancy‚Äôs famous Cold War novel, adding that it seemed ‚Äúmore like the hunt for the nearest mechanic‚Äù than The Hunt for Red October.\nSpeculation over possible technical issues first emerged on 27 September, when VChK-OGPU, a Telegram channel known for publishing alleged Russian security leaks, claimed that fuel had leaked into the hold of the Novorossiysk in the Strait of Gibraltar, increasing the risk of an explosion.\nNATO‚Äôs Maritime Command also released photographs on 9 October showing a French navy frigate observing a surfaced Russian submarine off the coast of Brittany. The command said on social media that NATO forces remained vigilant and ready to defend the Alliance, though it did not identify the vessel.\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the Russian Black Sea Fleet dismissed all reports of a malfunction, describing them as ‚Äúinaccurate‚Äù. It said the submarine, which entered service in 2014 and is capable of carrying Kalibr cruise missiles, had not experienced any emergency surfacing.\nThe fleet reiterated that the surfacing was carried out in accordance with international maritime navigation regulations.\nThe UK‚Äôs Minister for the Armed Forces, Al Carns, commented that the Royal Navy‚Äôs latest operation was a ‚Äúclear sign‚Äù of the UK‚Äôs commitment to stand strong with NATO allies and counter Russian aggression.\nThe monitoring operation came only two weeks after the Royal Navy had tracked a Russian frigate and cargo vessel passing through the Channel.\nReference: Reuters\n‚öìÔ∏è Enhance Your Knowledge.
