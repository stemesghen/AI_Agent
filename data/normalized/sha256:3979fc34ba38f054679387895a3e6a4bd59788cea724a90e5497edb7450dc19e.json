  "content_text": "Port fees skyrocket amidst US-China trade tensions\nPole Star Global (maritime intelligence technology) offers vessel tracking and can provide the location of the ships in real-time, along with other appropriate information.\nIn response to this news, Saleem Khan, Chief Data & Analytics Officer, Pole Star Global has this initial comment and data to share. If you’d like to speak further with him for comment, or to source a set of customised data, let us know. For now, comment follows and two tables. If you use the data, please would you credit Pole Star Global.\nSaleem Khan, Chief Data & Analytics Officer, Pole Star Global says:\n“We are seeing Chinese vessels that are being screened by our customers nearing zero. This is a concerning drop from the number we saw in January 2025, where 1,678 Chinese vessels entered the US and were screened by our customers.\n“As you can see with Pole Star data, the new port-fees have already started to change behavior in the shipping market. In the short term we should expect route changes, void sailings, and noticeable upward pressure on freight rates as carriers implement surcharges or GRIs (General Rate Increases) to pass the cost to shippers.”\nSource: Pole Star Global"
