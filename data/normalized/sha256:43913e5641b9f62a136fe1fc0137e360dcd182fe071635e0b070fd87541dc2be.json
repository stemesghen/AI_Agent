  "content_text": "Rozema Boat Works Receives USCG Contract\nRozema Boat Works, Inc., of Mount Vernon, Washington, was recently awarded a multi-year IDIQ contract by the U.S. Coast Guard for the construction of up to six second-generation Special Purpose Craft – Heavy Weather (SPC-HWX II) vessels. The all-aluminum boats are designed for extreme weather operations and will replace the legacy 52-foot SPC-HWX boats, which were originally commissioned in the 1950s and 1960s and officially retired in 2021.\nRozema Boat Works is joined by a strong design and engineering team for this effort. Camarc Design, a UK-based naval architecture firm with a strong track record in high-performance patrol craft, is providing the vessel design. Elliott Bay Design Group, of Seattle, Washington, is supporting with U.S.-based engineering services and technical data compliance.\nThe 64-ft SPC-HWX II will support a wide range of Coast Guard missions including search and rescue, disabled vessel towing, law enforcement, ports, waterways, and coastal security. These next-generation vessels will serve primarily in the Pacific Northwest, operating in severe offshore conditions that exceed the capabilities of other Coast Guard boats.\nPowered by twin 1,200 hp MAN diesel engines, the SPC-HWX II is capable of operating up to 150 miles offshore, reaching speeds of 20 knots, and has a bollard pull greater than 18,000 pounds. The vessel is designed for self-righting in surf and can withstand 35-ft seas, 25-ft surf, and wind conditions up to 60 knots. Accommodations for a relief crew allow for an endurance of up to 48 hours—critical for long-range response in harsh environments.\nThe first Vessel is expected to be delivered in fiscal year 2027."
